# About Me  

## Activism & Advocacy  
I am an activist committed to exposing corruption and fighting for justice. My work with **#OpRollRedRoll** helped bring global attention to systemic failures in law enforcement, the judiciary, and educational institutions. Through organizing protests and amplifying voices, I played a role in holding corrupt officials accountable.

The movement gained worldwide traction, leading to the critically acclaimed documentary *Roll Red Roll*, directed by Nancy Schwartzman. The film premiered at the **Tribeca Film Festival** in 2018 and was later released on **Netflix**, PBS, and other platforms. It exposes the deep-seated culture of impunity surrounding sexual violence and the complicity of institutions that protect perpetrators.  

The **WikiLeaks page** documenting **#OpRollRedRoll** was originally written by **@bullyville, @knightsec, and myself**, yet credit was later misattributed to **Commander X**. This misrepresentation does not erase the work we did to bring justice and accountability to light.  

### Steubenville Case & KnightSec  
According to a [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/sports/hackers-of-steubenville-football-teams-web-site-demand-apology-in-rape-case.html), hacktivists demanded accountability from Steubenville officials after the rape case gained national attention. The group **KnightSec**, a faction of Anonymous, played a crucial role in exposing evidence that mainstream media and authorities had overlooked.  

A [case study analysis](https://www.academia.edu/8955840/A_Case_Study_Analysis_of_KnightSec_and_the_Steubenville_Rape_Case) of **KnightSec** details how the movement leveraged social media and digital activism to challenge institutional corruption. The study highlights how hacktivists used online platforms to amplify survivor voices and demand justice.  

I stand in solidarity with oppressed communities, advocating for **Palestinian rights** and challenging corrupt governments worldwide. My activism is rooted in truth, accountability, and the unwavering belief that justice must prevail.
